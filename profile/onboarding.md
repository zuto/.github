# Welcome to Zuto’s Engineering Team - some basic onboarding! 

## Github

We use GitHub for version control, that's this website! Currently you can only see Zuto’s public repos. You’ll need to join the Zuto organisation before you can see the rest.

We can either invite your existing personal GitHub account, or if you prefer, you can create a new GitHub profile linked with your work email and we'll send the invite there instead. 

Once you've got your GitHub username let your tech lead or engineering manager know and they'll invite you to join! You'll need to set up two factor authentication on the account as a requirement to join if you haven't already.

As a side-note - if you go for the work email option, make sure to confirm the authentication email you’ll get as this will need to happen before you can pull any repos down.

## Slack

This is where the Engineering Team chat. Register using your work email [here](https://zuto.slack.com/signup#/domain-signup). 

## VPN

On your laptop you’ll have a program called FortiClient. This will give you access to the VPN when you’re working anywhere other than the office. Use your SSO (microsoft account) login to access. 

## Sharepoint

Sharepoint is the main hub for what’s going on across different departments in Zuto. Have a look on the [Knowledge Hub](https://carloan4uuk.sharepoint.com/sites/KnowledgeHub). 

Make sure to also have a look at the [People Hub](https://carloan4uuk.sharepoint.com/sites/KnowledgeHub/SitePages/People-Hub.aspx) which is where Zuto’s policies are along with relevant HR information.
